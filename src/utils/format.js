/*
The file format.js is likely intended to contain utility functions for formatting data in your project. Common formatting utilities in such a file might include:

Formatting prices or currency (e.g., converting numbers to "€12.99" or "$10.00")
Formatting dates and times for display
Formatting numbers (e.g., adding commas to thousands)
Capitalizing or transforming strings for UI
Any other reusable formatting logic needed across your app
If you want to see what is currently in the file or need suggestions for specific formatting functions, let me know! I can also read the file and summarize or help you implement standard formatting utilities.
